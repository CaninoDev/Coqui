<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Keyboard Layout][keyboard-layout]](https://github.com/CaninoDev/CoquiKeyboard)

The coquí is a species of frog native to the island of Puerto Rico. Typically, they are no larger than penny. They are so named for the loud mating call, _co-kee_. Similarly, this keyboard is a compact 40% keyboard with an extra column of two keys on the right intended for volume control. This keyboard is loosely based on  [Clueboard](https://clueboard.co/)


### Built With
The initial design was created with the help of [Keyboard Layout Editor](www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) with input from @alexicon and @critray.
The schematic and pcb was created in [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org), an open source software.
